Duplicacy Web Edition

This is the full-featured web-based GUI frontend supporting all major operations
(backup, restore, check, copy, and prune) as well as other features such as
scheduling and email notifications. It also integrates a dashboard to provide
a graphical view of the status of storages and backups.

This version can be used without a license if you only need the restore, check,
copy, and prune operations. If you do need to run backups, a fully functional
30-day trial license will be automatically downloaded to enable the backup
operation. After 30 days, a personal or commercial license can be purchased from
the licenses [0] page.
